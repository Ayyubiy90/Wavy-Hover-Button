# Wavy

This is a simple web page with two buttons that have a wavy animation when hovered over.

## Instructions

To view the animation, open the index.html file in a web browser.

## Code Explanation

The animation is achieved using the following CSS properties:

* `transform`: This property is used to rotate the `before` and `after` elements of the buttons.
* `background`: This property is used to set the background color of the `before` and `after` elements.
* `transition`: This property is used to animate the changes to the `transform` and `background` properties.
